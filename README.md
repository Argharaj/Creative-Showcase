# Creative Showcase

Creative Showcase is a web application where users can sign up, upload images, and display their work in a shared gallery. Each image shown on the home page includes the username of the person who uploaded it.

The project is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and focuses on user interaction, image handling, and clean page navigation. It is built as a learning project to practice core web development concepts.
